# WASI Filesystem API

WASI filesystem is a filesystem API primarily intended to let users run WASI
programs that access their files on their existing filesystems, without
significant overhead.

It is intended to be roughly portable between Unix-family platforms and
Windows, though it does not hide many of the major differences.

## `filesize`
```wit
/// Non-negative file size or length of a region within a file.
type filesize = u64
```

## `filedelta`
```wit
/// Relative offset within a file.
type filedelta = s64
```

## `timestamp`
```wit
/// Timestamp in nanoseconds.
///
/// TODO: wasi-clocks is moving to seconds+nanoseconds.
type timestamp = u64
```

## `info`
```wit
/// Information associated with a descriptor.
///
/// Note: This was called `fdstat` in earlier versions of WASI.
record info {
    /// The type of filesystem object referenced by a descriptor.
    type: type,
    /// Flags associated with a descriptor.
    flags: flags,
}
```

## `type`
```wit
/// The type of a filesystem object referenced by a descriptor.
///
/// Note: This was called `filetype` in earlier versions of WASI.
enum type {
    /// The type of the descriptor or file is unknown or is different from
    /// any of the other types specified.
    unknown,
    /// The descriptor refers to a block device inode.
    block_device,
    /// The descriptor refers to a character device inode.
    character_device,
    /// The descriptor refers to a directory inode.
    directory,
    /// The descriptor refers to a named pipe.
    fifo,
    /// The file refers to a symbolic link inode.
    symbolic_link,
    /// The descriptor refers to a regular file inode.
    regular_file,
    /// The descriptor refers to a socket.
    socket,

```

## `flags`
```wit
/// Descriptor flags.
///
/// Note: This was called `fdflags` in earlier versions of WASI.
flags flags {
    /// Read mode: Data can be read.
    read,
    /// Write mode: Data can be written to.
    write,
    /// Append mode: Data written to the file is always appended to the file's
    /// end.
    append,
    /// Write according to synchronized I/O data integrity completion. Only the
    /// data stored in the file is synchronized.
    dsync,
    /// Non-blocking mode.
    nonblock,
    /// Synchronized read I/O operations.
    rsync,

    /// addition to synchronizing the data stored in the file, the
    /// implementation may also synchronously update the file's metadata.

```

## `stat`
```wit

  /// File type.

```
